# Memothon

memothon is a spaced-repetition flashcard system designed for simplicity.

Features:
- Front and back cards each with one attached media file
- Markdown support + syntax highlighting
- Better card creation using AI tools
- Schedules reviews with enough spacing between them
- Offline first: you don't have to sync at all if you don't want to
- Self-hostable: everything is open source so you can host your own frontend or sync server
- Above all, simplicity to make the focus on your cards, not hyper-optimization
